# Getting Started

This project is built on core web technologies: HTML, Sass, and minimal JavaScript. Itâ€™s a return to fundamentals, focused on clarity and performance.

Sass, a powerful CSS extension language, is used to simplify and scale stylesheets. A recommended tool is the New Live Sass Compiler, especially since the older versions are now deprecated.
----------

As surprising as it might sound after such a long time experimenting with different libraries and frameworks, this project is based upon the essential elements giving our work _real_ sense: [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (also known as "CSS with superpowers". Woah!), and minimal usage of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Back to the roots, guys.

Undoubtedly (and before someone tries to kill me), CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers, as we all know. When it comes to Sass, it's usually described as the most mature, stable, and powerful professional-grade CSS extension language in the world. Actively supported and developed by a consortium of several tech companies and hundreds of developers, there are an endless number of frameworks built with Sass, like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), for instance. Quite an interesting frontend toolkit, in my opinion.

Independently of that, and just in case you are not familiar with Sass, I would highly recommend giving the [New Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) a try now that the old one is deprecated. Keep something in mind, though: there is no "best" here. If anything, the "best" option will always be the one that fits _your specific needs_ better, so feel free to give different tools until you find **the** one for your future project!
